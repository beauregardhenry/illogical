# #317 on Linux, in the Xvfb container (`just desktop-xvfb stale`): the app
# ($1, a debug build) never shows a daemon older than 0.19.0, and never
# updates it either (#392: the daemon updates itself). The older daemon is
# a stand-in (old-daemon.py: 0.8.0, no protocol) installed as the service:
# a ~/.local/bin/illogicald that runs it, and a unit that systemctl (a
# stand-in too, on PATH) runs.
#
#   stopped  the service is installed but not running: the app starts it,
#            finds 0.8.0 too old and stays on its setup page
#   running  the same with 0.8.0 already running
#
# Each asserts the app said why (0.8.0 runs, 0.19.0 is needed), that 0.8.0
# still answers (the app didn't replace it) and that it served no page,
# only the app's calls under /api and the watcher's /ws.
