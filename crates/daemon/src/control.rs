//! Enrolled in illogical control (M17, M18): who may connect, and the way
//! in through control's relay.
//!
//! `illogicald join URL` makes this daemon's keys (`<state>/daemon.key`),
//! asks control for a code, and waits until someone approves it from a
//! device of theirs. It then shows the account's fingerprint (its root
//! device's id), which the person checks against the device they approved
//! on: control could otherwise hand back an account of its own. Only then
//! does it pin that root and save it all in `<state>/control.json`. The
//! running daemon notices the file (within a few seconds), and from then
//! on:
//!
//! - it keeps the account's certificates fresh from control, but decides
//!   for itself which devices to trust ([`Trust::evaluate`] against the
//!   pinned root), so control can't add one;
//! - it keeps a socket open to control's relay and serves channels over
//!   it, for clients that can't reach it directly;
//! - `/e2e` serves the same channels directly (tailnet, LAN).
//!
//! When control is down, the last certificates it sent keep working.
//! `illogicald leave` tells control and removes the file.
//!
//! While running, the daemon keeps its standing with control ([`State`],
//! `/api/host`'s `control_state`, #325): not joined, joined (connected or
//! not, and the last thing that went wrong), or dropped. Dropped is control
//! saying it has no such machine: a 401 that [`forgotten`] confirms (it
//! left, or its account was deleted), or a 410 for a key removed from a
//! browser (#330). The daemon says so in its log once and keeps what control
//! said, and when, in `<state>/control-dropped.json` until a new join or
//! control knowing it again. After a 401 it keeps `control.json`, stops
//! redialling the relay and asks again only every [`DROPPED_RETRY`]; after
//! a 410 it sets the key aside and asks to join again with a new one by
//! itself ([`Control::start`]). When `control.json` goes away the log says
//! whether `illogicald leave`, a join again or setting a removed key aside
//! took it, from the note each leaves in `<state>/control-left.json`, or
//! something else did.
