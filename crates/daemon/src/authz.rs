//! The API for someone who isn't the owner (M12). The owner can call
//! anything. Anyone else reaches only calls about one pane or block, in a
//! session shared with them: reading it as a viewer, driving it (typing,
//! keys, answering, approving an agent) as an editor. Everything that
//! reaches the machine itself (files, new panes, machines, history across
//! panes, hosts, sharing) stays the owner's.
//!
//! The WebSocket is checked in the mux, per message; this is the HTTP half.
