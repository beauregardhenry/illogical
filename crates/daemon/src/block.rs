//! Blocks that aren't terminals: what every type provides, and how the
//! multiplexer makes them.
//!
//! A terminal is the first block type and keeps its own fast path
//! (`pane.rs`: PTY bytes, snapshots and offsets). Every other type
//! implements [`Block`]:
//!
//! - **config**, saved in `layout.json`: what it needs to be made again;
//! - **state**, as JSON: what its renderer in the client draws and what
//!   `describe` returns, pushed to clients whenever it changes;
//! - **attention**, through the same notices as terminals, so badges, the
//!   "needs you" list and push notifications work for every type;
//! - **text**, a plain rendering for `capture --text`, history and search;
//! - **methods**, called as `illogical call %N <method> [json]`;
//! - **a log** in its own block directory, in the M2 segment store: what
//!   it did, or for a view of something kept elsewhere (a file, a repo),
//!   only what it was pointed at, when (M11);
//! - **drawn**: told whether any client draws it now (a full client
//!   showing its tab; summaries don't count), so a view that watches a
//!   machine can stop and let the machine sleep (M11).
//!
//! All blocks share one id space (`%N`) and one place in the layout tree.
