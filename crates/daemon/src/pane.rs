//! A pane: a process on a PTY (here, or an exec TTY on a machine), the
//! server-side terminal state it draws, its history on disk, and the clients
//! watching it.
//!
//! Each pane runs a VT thread that owns everything stateful (libghostty's
//! terminal is `!Send`). PTY output, client attaches, resizes and process
//! exits all arrive on one channel, so a client's snapshot or replay and the
//! live output after it are always in order, and the log on disk sees the
//! same bytes in the same order.
