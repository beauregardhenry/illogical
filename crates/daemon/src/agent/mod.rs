//! Agent blocks (M6b): an agent run as structured UI, driven over the Agent
//! Client Protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 on the agent server's stdio).
//!
//! The block is an ACP client. It starts an agent server (Claude Code
//! through `claude-agent-acp`, Codex through `codex-acp`, a Fountain agent
//! through `fountain acp`, or any ACP command; see [`defs`]), opens a
//! session, and turns `session/update`s into a transcript: your prompts, the
//! agent's messages and thoughts, and tool calls with their commands'
//! output. Permission requests become cards with approve and deny.
//!
//! **The log is the JSON-RPC stream.** Every frame in either direction is a
//! line in the block's log (`{"t":ms,"d":"in"|"out","m":frame}`), plus notes
//! of our own (`"d":"note"`: the server started or stopped, a denial's
//! reason). Everything else (the transcript, open permission requests, our
//! outstanding requests and next id, cost) is rebuilt from it by the same
//! code that handles frames live, so a restarted daemon picks up exactly
//! where the last one was.
//!
//! **Turn state** comes from the protocol: `working` while our
//! `session/prompt` is outstanding, `needs-input` while a permission request
//! is open (which pushes to the phone), `done` or `idle` from the stop
//! reason.
//!
//! **Permissions.** "Always allow" is a rule in the block's config, answered
//! by the block itself: it never picks the agent's `allow_always`, which
//! `claude-agent-acp` writes into your repo's `.claude/settings.local.json`.
//! A standing rule (#166, [`crate::rules`]) is "always" kept by the daemon
//! for a directory or every block; blocks check those after their own.
//! Cancelling a turn answers open requests `cancelled`; a card goes when its
//! tool call ends (Fountain refuses an unanswered request after 5 minutes
//! without telling the client).
//!
//! **Questions and forms** (M6c). The block declares form and URL
//! elicitation, so Claude's AskUserQuestion arrives as `elicitation/create`
//! (without the capability the adapter disables the tool). One whose
//! `toolCallId` is an AskUserQuestion tool call becomes a question card
//! (its questions from the tool call's `rawInput`); any other form is drawn
//! from its schema, and a URL elicitation is a card with a link. They are
//! open requests like permissions: `needs-input`, in the log, answered by
//! id (`answer`, `decline`). Stop is `session/cancel` alone: the agent
//! withdraws its own request with `$/cancel_request`.
//!
//! **Restarts.** A local agent server keeps running through a daemon
//! restart (its own scope; its pipes in the FD store; see [`link`]). After a
//! reboot the block starts it again and reopens the session with
//! `session/resume` (no replay; the transcript is ours) or `session/load`
//! (whose replay is merged in). The restart policy decides whether that
//! happens by itself (`none` and `rerun-ask` wait for "Resume").
