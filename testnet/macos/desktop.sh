#   KEEP=1 ...     leave the clone running
#
# Claims, in this order (each needs the ones before it):
#   install   the .dmg mounts and the app copies to /Applications
#   agent     the first start registers the daemon's launch agent through
#             SMAppService (BTM lists it), the daemon answers, the CLI is
#             linked into ~/.local/bin, and no illogicald install plist exists
#   pane      the window shows a pane: typing a command into it runs it
#   keys      Ctrl-W, T, N, Q and Tab reach the pane as bytes; Cmd-W closes
#             the pane and not the window; Cmd-T opens a tab; Cmd-M leaves
#             the app running and its window up; Cmd-H hides the app and
#             Cmd-Q quits it (#320), and its panes keep running
#   links     `open illogical://open?cwd=DIR` opens a tab there and shows
#             it; `open illogical://pane/%N` shows pane N
#   finder    M47: the app's service is registered; right-clicking a
#             folder in Finder and picking *New illogical Tab Here* opens a
#             tab there in the running app and shows it; a .command file
#             opened with the app runs in a new tab
#   this      #323: the tray's *This machine*, clicked again and again,
#             brings forward the window already showing this machine: no
#             new window, no native tab
#   drag      #316: the page's bar moves the window as before, and so does
#             the top strip of a page with no drag markup (as an old
#             daemon's); a double-click there zooms it
#   tabs      Cmd-N opens a window as a native tab of the first; with two
#             and three tabs the page's bar sits below AppKit's tab bar
#             (#323); Cmd-Shift-W closes tabs back to one, and the strip
#             goes and the bar is back in the titlebar
#   hotkey    off by default; on (desktop.json), Ctrl-Option-Space hides
#             the app and brings it back
#   restart   the app quits and starts again; the daemon and its panes
#             stay (pids unchanged)
#
# And one not run by default, as it fetches a published release from
# GitHub instead of the .dmg (#318, #319):
#   installsh this tree's scripts/install.sh --app on the fresh account:
#             the app it puts in /Applications has no quarantine flag,
#             opens with no Gatekeeper window, and adopts install.sh's
#             daemon (no SMAppService agent); then, with /Applications not
#             writable, the same into ~/Applications. Gatekeeper's verdict
#             (spctl) is printed, not judged. ILLOGICAL_VERSION picks the
#             daemon's release (default: the latest), ILLOGICAL_APP_VERSION
#             the app's (default: app-latest).
#
# The .dmg is $ILLOGICAL_DMG, default dist/illogical-desktop-macos-arm64.dmg
# (`just desktop` on a Mac). The app
# is copied in without a quarantine flag: an ad-hoc signed app needs a
# person's right-click > Open past Gatekeeper, which only notarization
# (#177) removes. VM name: $ILLOGICAL_MACOS_VM (default illogical-macos-l).
# Exit codes: 0 every claim held (or no tart: a clean skip), 1 a claim
