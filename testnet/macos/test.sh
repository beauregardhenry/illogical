# launchd (S28 #153, M52 #155): a user made with sysadminctl who has never
# logged in to the GUI, reached only over ssh, installs the daemon with
# `illogicald install` and starts a pane, then switches to --system and
# uninstalls. In order, all in one VM:
#   install   `illogicald install` over ssh exits 0 and the daemon answers
#   warning   it said the daemon won't start after a reboot by itself and
#             named `illogicald install --system`
#   logout    after that ssh session ends, the daemon and its pane are there
#   uninstall-agent  `illogicald uninstall` leaves no plist, no service in
#             gui/UID or user/UID, and no illogicald running as the user
#   ssh       `illogical --ssh illo@vm ls` from the host (M52's path) starts
#             the daemon there and passes the warning through
#   system    `illogicald install --system` (sudo) switches cleanly: a
#             LaunchDaemon in system/illogicald.illo, no agent plist, no
#             user/UID service, and the daemon answers
#   reboot    after a clean shutdown and `tart run`, with nobody logged in as that
#             user, the daemon is running with the pane made under --system
#   uninstall `illogicald uninstall` removes the LaunchDaemon: no plist, no
#             service, no illogicald running as the user
# BREAK=1: the daemon's launchd service is disabled and booted out before
# install, logout, system and reboot are checked; the install's `note:`
# line is dropped before warning; each uninstall is followed by an install
# (something left behind); and the daemon is already running when the ssh
# check starts it, so nothing is said.
#
# Binaries come from $ILLOGICAL_MACOS_BIN (default target/debug, as `cargo
# build -p illogicald -p illogical` leaves them). Exit codes: 0 every claim
# held (or no tart: a clean skip), 1 a claim failed, 2 usage.
