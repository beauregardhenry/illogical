# Development

## Build from source

You need [rustup](https://rustup.rs) (the toolchain is pinned in
`rust-toolchain.toml`), [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) (it installs the exact
Zig that libghostty needs, from `.mise.toml`), [just](https://just.systems),
Node and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). On macOS, the Xcode command line tools too,
and for the tests a bash newer than the system's 3.2 (`brew install bash`):
the shell integration needs bash 4.4.

```
just bootstrap      # Zig via mise, web dependencies
just install        # release build, installed and started as a service
```

The daemon embeds the web client (`web/dist`) at build time, so build
through `just` (`just build`, `just install`); a bare `cargo build
--release` stops and says to build the web client first. `just static`
builds static Linux binaries (musl, with Zig as the C compiler);
`just static aarch64` builds them for arm64. `just dist` makes the
release tarballs in `dist/`.

## Working on it

`just dev` runs a separate daemon on 7682 (state in
`~/.local/state/illogical-dev`) plus Vite on 5173, leaving the real one
alone. [testing.md](testing.md) covers the tests, fakes and fixtures.
`just test-scripts` tests install.sh and checks that what a release
ships (targets, desktop downloads) is named the same in release.yml,
app-release.yml, scripts/release, the Homebrew formula, install.sh and the site: add a
target or download and it says what else needs it. `just check` is what
CI runs; `just e2e` drives the system Chrome
against throwaway daemons, or `just e2e https://home.<tailnet>.ts.net`
against the running one. `workspace.spec.ts` runs the real chant: its first run
installs the pinned version into `web/e2e/fixtures/chant-workspace` with
`npm ci` (CI doesn't run the browser tests; the daemon's own workspace
tests use a stand-in chant). `just screenshots` regenerates the images in
`site/img/` from a throwaway daemon with a scripted demo session
(`SHOTS_PORT` and `SHOTS_DEV_PORT` move its ports); the README's
`dive.gif` is the page's own tour, made by `web/screenshots/dive.mjs`.

`just testnet up ssh` starts a local stack in Docker (`testnet/`, #200): a
bastion and a box with no illogical that only ssh reaches. `just testnet
test` runs its claims; `testnet/README.md` lists them.

## Releasing

The daemon and the desktop app release apart (#388): a daemon or web change
ships without rebuilding, signing and notarizing the apps, and an app
release carries the newest daemon without building it.
`releases/latest` is always the daemon's: install.sh, install.ps1 and the
daemon's update check read it.

**The daemon (`v*`).**

1. Set the version in the workspace `Cargo.toml` and commit (`just
   notices` if dependencies changed; CI fails if THIRD_PARTY.md is stale).
   Notes go in `docs/releases/X.Y.Z.md`.
2. `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "illogical X.Y.Z" && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
   `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the Linux tarballs on geek, the
   macOS ones on jake-mini (Apple silicon natively, Intel cross-compiled
   with `just build-macos-x86_64`) and the Windows zip on GitHub's runner,
   attaches them and `SHA256SUMS` to the GitHub release, publishes it as
   latest, and bumps the formula in `arugula-salad/homebrew-tap`
   (`scripts/release`; the tap's deploy key is the `HOMEBREW_TAP_KEY`
   secret). It builds no app.
3. Running daemons find it within 12 hours and offer *Update now*
   (`illogicald update` from a terminal); `install.sh` picks it up by
   itself. If the page changed, `just site-deploy` publishes it (wrangler's
   login on geek).

**The app (`app-v*`)**, only when `crates/desktop` changes:

1. Set the version in `crates/desktop/Cargo.toml` (its own numbering, not
   the daemon's) and commit. Notes go in `docs/releases/app-X.Y.Z.md`.
2. `git tag -a app-vX.Y.Z -m "illogical app X.Y.Z" && git push origin
   app-vX.Y.Z`. `.github/workflows/app-release.yml` downloads illogicald
   and illogical from the latest daemon release (checked against its
   `SHA256SUMS`) for the app to carry, builds and signs the apps (Linux on
   geek, macOS on jake-mini, notarized with the Developer ID when its
   secrets are set, Windows on GitHub's runner), and publishes the release
   with its own `SHA256SUMS` and the updater's `latest.json`. It's never
   marked latest.
3. It copies the downloads, `SHA256SUMS` and `latest.json` to the rolling
   `app-latest` release, whose tag follows the newest app's commit. The
   site's download buttons and the updater's endpoint
   (`tauri.conf.json`) point there, so they get the new app at once.
4. Apps from before the split (0.23 and older) have no updater key, so they
   never check: their people install the new app once, by hand.

`scripts/release` (`check-version`, `sums`, `publish`, `homebrew` for the
daemon; `check-app-version`, `sidecars`, `app-upload`, `app-publish` for the
app) checks that `releases/latest` is still a daemon release after each
publish. `scripts/tests/release-targets.sh` (`just test-scripts`) fails if the
daemon's workflow builds an app, or if the downloads the app's workflow
makes, the ones `scripts/release` requires and the ones the site links
drift apart.

In this repo (beauregardhenry/illogical), `check.yml` runs on GitHub's
hosted runners instead: Ubuntu, and macOS on both Apple silicon and Intel
(`macos-15-intel`, Sequoia). `.github/actions/tools` installs what the
self-hosted machines already had. Only the Ubuntu runner has Docker, so it
runs the testnet and the ssh tests; the macOS jobs skip those, saying so
(`ILLOGICAL_SKIP_DOCKER=1`). Upstream's full Playwright run (`just e2e`)
isn't part of it: on these runners some specs can't pass (no nvim, frame
and timing budgets set for upstream's machines, `tc netem`); the macOS
jobs run the WebKit specs. `macos-intel.yml` and `forges-nightly.yml`
run only upstream (check.yml covers Intel here, and the forges need
upstream's runners and secrets), and `release.yml` still names the
self-hosted runners below, so a tag doesn't release from here.

Upstream, CI runs on two self-hosted GitHub Actions runners in the arugula-salad
org's `illogical` runner group, which only this repo may use: geek
(`linux-x86_64`, a systemd user service,
`~/.config/systemd/user/actions-runner-illogical.service`, runner in
`~/.local/share/actions-runner-illogical`), geek's CI pool (eight more,
`linux-x86_64-ci`, `actions-runner-illogical-e2e@1…8.service` from one
template unit, runners in `~/.local/share/actions-runner-illogical-e2e-N`,
which run check.yml's jobs on geek side by side; 9–12 are registered but
disabled: twelve with no limits kept geek at load 30+ and failed the tests
that time things. The drop-in `actions-runner-illogical-e2e@.service.d/limits.conf`
puts them in `illogical-ci.slice` (CPUWeight 50 under the desktop, 96 GB
for all of CI) and gives each 20 GB; `scripts/ci-env` caps nextest and
cargo at six threads, rather than a CPUQuota, which stalls a runner for
the rest of its period and times tests out. The drop-in also sets
`KillMode=control-group` (the template's `process` stopped `run.sh`
alone, and the next start ran a second listener beside the old one), so
stopping a runner cancels its job: drain it first, `gh api -X DELETE
orgs/arugula-salad/actions/runners/ID/labels` (needs `admin:org`), wait
for `.busy` false, restart, then `PUT` its three labels back. More is `cp -a` of one
without `_work`, `.runner` and `.credentials*`, `config.sh --runnergroup
illogical --labels linux-x86_64,linux-x86_64-e2e,linux-x86_64-ci` with an
org registration token, and `systemctl --user enable --now` of the next
number) and jake-mini (`macos-arm64`, releases only: check.yml's macos job
runs on GitHub's `macos-15`, as one runner kept every run waiting; a
launchd agent, `~/Library/LaunchAgents/illogical.actions-runner.plist`,
with `ProcessType` Interactive: launchd's throttling of background agents
made daemon tests time out; Docker is colima, a Homebrew service). All run jobs on the host and keep their
build in `~/.cache/illogical-ci/`, which each job deletes first once it
passes 30 GB (`scripts/ci-cap-target`): cargo never prunes it, and on
2026-10-02 it grew to 136 GB, filled jake-mini's disk and took the home
cluster down. Workflows run on pushes and tags only, never on pull
requests, since they run on those hosts; and the repo asks for approval
before any outside contributor's workflow runs, so a fork's PR can't add
a trigger of its own and reach them. Intel Macs are the exception:
`.github/workflows/macos-intel.yml` runs `just test` and builds the
tarball and the app on GitHub's `macos-15-intel` runner, which isn't
ours. It takes about an hour cold, so it runs weekly on main and by hand
(`gh workflow run macos-intel.yml --ref BRANCH`), and keeps both as
artifacts; every push lints the Intel build on geek (`just check-macos
x86_64`). A job's log: `gh run view --log
<run id>` (or `--log-failed`).

The repo moved from Forgejo (`git.inevitable.fyi/jhgaylor/illogical`,
archived; v0.1.0–v0.12.0 assets are still there) on 2026-10-03, with issue
and PR numbers kept.

## Testing iTerm2

`just macos iterm2` checks attach, typing, output, a split and a new tab
in a real iTerm2 inside a tart VM ([testing.md](testing.md#a-fresh-mac-the-tart-vm-harness)).
The rest of this script is still by hand. From the Mac, against geek:

1. On geek, install the build (`just install`) and check `illogical ls`
   works. Open <https://geek.tail1234.ts.net> in a browser beside iTerm2.
2. In iTerm2: `ssh -t geek '~/.local/bin/illogical tmux -CC attach'`. A new
   iTerm2 window opens with a tab per illogical tab (the gateway window
   says "tmux mode"). The tab's shell prompt is there, with its history.
3. Type `ls` and Enter in it: the output appears in iTerm2 and in the
   browser's same pane.
4. *Shell › Split Vertically*, then *Split Horizontally*: three native
   splits; the browser shows the same three panes within a second.
5. Drag an iTerm2 divider: the browser's divider moves to match. Drag one
   in the browser: iTerm2's moves. Resize the iTerm2 window: the panes
   reflow and the browser letterboxes the tab at iTerm2's size; click in
   the browser's pane and type, and the browser takes the size back.
6. ⌘T for a new tab: a new tab appears in the browser too. Close it in
   iTerm2 (⌘W, *Kill*): it goes from the browser. Close a split with
   `exit`: its pane goes from both.
7. Run `vim` (or `htop`) in a pane, type a little, and leave it running.
8. Detach (*Shell › tmux › Detach*). The iTerm2 windows close; vim keeps
   running in the browser.
9. Reattach with the same `ssh` command: the tabs and splits come back as
   they were, with vim on screen; quit it with `:q` and the shell prompt is
   on the line after the `vim` command.
10. In the browser, split a pane and open a new tab: iTerm2 shows both.

Watch for: an alert from iTerm2 about an unexpected reply (it disconnects
on any error it doesn't expect; note the command it names), panes that
stay blank after attach, output in the wrong pane, a window that keeps
resizing itself when both iTerm2 and the browser are open, and garbled
screens after a reattach. To record the conversation, start it with
`ILLOGICAL_TMUX_LOG`: `ssh -t geek 'ILLOGICAL_TMUX_LOG=/tmp/cc.log
~/.local/bin/illogical tmux -CC attach'` writes every line both ways (`>`
from iTerm2, `<` to it) to `/tmp/cc.log` on geek.

## Layout

See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the crate map and the daemon's layers. Each crate has a `README.md` with what it is, what it depends on inside the workspace, and where to start reading.

## Things M0–M4c taught us

- **Don't promise what the client can't draw.** libghostty answered Neovim's
  "do you support left/right margins?" with yes, Neovim used them for
  vertical splits, and xterm.js drew garbage. The engine now rewrites its
  replies to xterm.js's measured capabilities (`crates/vt/src/compat.rs`), and
  the client stops xterm.js from answering queries itself, so programs get
  exactly one answer whether or not anyone is attached.
- **libghostty in a debug build is ~3000x slower** (0.2 MB/s). `.cargo/config.toml`
  builds it as Zig ReleaseSafe in every profile: 175–580 MB/s, with safety
  checks kept, since it parses untrusted program output.
- **A library's thread-locals are every thread's** (M9). Zig's 256 KiB
  threadlocal signal stack went into the daemon's static TLS, and glibc
  gave every thread a zeroed copy: 1.3 MB per pane. Check `readelf -S`
  for `.tbss` after a libghostty upgrade. glibc also kept about half a busy
  daemon's peak after panes closed, until `heap.rs` fixed the mmap
  threshold. `crates/daemon/tests/integration/memory.rs` guards both.
- **Offsets need an epoch.** A reconnecting client's offset is only valid for
  the stream it came from; the pane's epoch changes when the daemon restarts.
- **Size travels in order with output.** A client must resize before drawing
  a snapshot, so size changes share the bounded output queue. Only the
  "you fell behind, resync" notice uses a separate channel.
- **Cells, not pixels.** The plan said react-mosaic; it lays panes out in
  its own pixels, which drift from the PTY sizes. The daemon computes cell
  rectangles instead (and M5's tmux layout strings come for free), and the
  client draws them.
- **Size is per tab.** With splits, one window's size decides every pane in a
  tab; per-pane ownership would mix a phone's and a desktop's sizes in one
  tab. A phone claims its tab with one pane zoomed; the others keep their
  sizes until a desktop takes the tab back.
- **WebGL drew nothing in phone emulation** (fractional pixel ratio), so
  touch devices use xterm's DOM renderer; desktops use WebGL for visible panes
  only and release contexts for hidden ones (Chrome allows ~16).
- **Preact 11 no longer appends `px`** to numeric styles. Zeros still worked,
  so the bug looked like a layout one.
- **Subscribe, then catch up.** A store subscription made in an effect misses
  anything that happens before the first paint; the daemon's hello sometimes
  won that race and left a window blank.
- **Upstream fixes move bugs.** The newer libghostty formatter fixed the
  cursor S1 had to re-place, but now writes tab stops before the content and
  leaves the cursor on the last stop, so the first line wrapped. The fixture
  tests caught it on the upgrade; the block is moved to the end.
- **Leaving the alternate screen restores the cursor** even when nothing is
  on it, so the restore marker only sends `?1049l` if a full-screen program
  was showing; otherwise it overwrote the last lines of scrollback.
- **A reboot kills shells and the daemon together.** `KillMode=mixed` stops
  the daemon first (it saves, then exits) and kills the shells after; and a
  shell killed by a signal never closes its pane, so even a race can't lose
  one.
- **"Re-run" reads /proc**, so `bash -c 'a; b'` that exec'd into `b` re-runs
  `b`. The typed command line needs shell integration (M3).
- **A restarted daemon isn't anyone's parent.** The shim records each
  program's pid, start time and exit status; the daemon watches through a
  `pidfd` (which works for non-children) and checks the start time before
  adopting, so a reused pid is never mistaken for the pane's program.
- **A pane closed as it starts can't leave its program behind.** The shim
  records the pid only after the exec, and it owns the SIGKILL that follows
  a close's hangup, so it happens even if the daemon is gone. Test daemons
  also kill whatever their state dir records as running before deleting it.
- **DECSTR doesn't reset input modes.** A pane restored after its program
  died kept that program's mouse and focus reporting, so clicking sent stray
  `ESC [ O` to the new shell. The restore marker now turns them off.
- **"What happened after I typed" needs the offset at send time.** `send`
  then `wait` raced: the pane recorded the input when it processed it, so a
  quick `wait` could return the previous command. The API now records it
  before queueing the input.
- **A notification outlives its command.** Attention set by OSC 9 was
  cleared a moment later when the `printf` that sent it finished.
- **Unix socket paths max out at ~108 bytes.** Long state directories get a
  socket in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` instead, recorded in `state/sock.path`.
- **wisp already had the fix for its replay.** The M3b spike found that
  reattaching resends the whole session and planned to ask for a `since=`
  parameter, but wisp's `output_offset` (not one of the names the spike
  tried) does exactly that. Each VM pane keeps its session id and how many
  bytes it has logged in `exec.json`, and reattaches from there.
- **bash expands `ENV`, command substitution included,** so a VM's shell
  gets the integration with nothing installed: the script travels in an
  environment variable and `ENV='$(…)'` writes it to a temporary file.
- **`kill?signal=HUP` ends a VM shell at once;** wisp's default TERM waits
  10s, because an interactive bash ignores it.
- **A tab's title follows its active pane,** so grabbing a pane to drag it
  can resize its tab under the pointer. The tests aim after the pane is
  active, and anything that measures the tab bar mid-drag should too.
- **In userspace mode, the tailnet arrives on loopback.** tailscaled's
  netstack forwards a tailnet connection to the daemon's port as one from
  127.0.0.1, with any Host header the sender likes, so "loopback means
  local" would let in anyone the ACL lets reach the sandbox. The daemon asks
  tailscaled's WhoIs about every peer there (it knows forwarded
  connections); a second daemon in a sprite with another owner refused geek
  even with a forged loopback Host and serve header.
- **serve sends no identity for tagged nodes** (or Funnel). A request for
  the tailnet name without `Tailscale-User-Login` used to pass as local;
  with sandboxes on the tailnet that would have handed geek's terminals to
  any tagged node the ACL let through. It is refused now, except joining
  the host list with an invite.
- **Zig as a musl C compiler:** cc-rs passes a Rust-style `--target=` that
  Zig rejects, and Zig turns on UBSan for unoptimized C (aws-lc's
  jitterentropy), whose runtime nothing links. `scripts/zig-cc-musl` drops
  the one and turns off the other.
- **Children inherit a blocked signal mask.** The sandbox supervisor
  blocks SIGTERM to wait for it, and std's `Command` passed that on: the
  daemon never heard SIGTERM and was killed instead of saving its panes.
- **A restarted tailscaled says `Starting` for a moment.** A daemon that
  asked then got no tailnet name (and refused its own URL), and an install
  that asked then logged in again. Both wait for it to settle now.
- **Through the home daemon, a host's answer is the home daemon's.** A
  dial-out host's responses are served on geek's origin, so a hostile
  sandbox could have put a page there with the run of geek's API. Only its
  WebSocket and `/api` are forwarded, and every answer is defanged (a
  `sandbox` CSP, `nosniff`, no cookies or CORS).
- **Match paths exactly where identity is relaxed.** A prefix check let
  `/share/<token>/../api/panes` through the viewer's door (the router then
  found nothing, but only by luck); the guard now accepts the exact shapes.
- **clap gives a subcommand's positional the same id as a global flag of
  the same name.** `illogical synced rm sbx` set `--host sbx`. A
  subcommand's own `--host` loses to the global one the same way, so
  `open` and `agent` take `--machine mN`, like `edit` (#61); a `--host
  mN` there that isn't in the host list says so.
- **"Cold" can be had on demand.** wisp turns a suspended sprite cold
  after `--warm-ttl` (1h) by dropping its memory snapshot, which makes the
  next wake a real boot. Its web UI's operator endpoints do the same at
  once (`POST /ui/api/sprites/NAME/suspend`, then `/cool`, with a session
  from `/ui/login`), which is how `resident.spec.ts` tests a cold wake.
  Suspending syncs the guest's disks first, so the resident daemon's log
  and checkpoints are there after the reboot.
- **A TUI on the main screen leaves the cursor mid-screen.** Claude Code
  draws in place and doesn't use the alternate screen, so after a restore
  the marker landed on top of it; it now goes below the last row with
  text.
- **Sprites lists are paged** (50 at a time); wisp here holds more than
  that.

- **A program's exit can overtake its last output.** A pane's reader and
  its wait for the exit are separate threads, so a quick `illogical run`
  could end its command before its output arrived, and `capture
  --scope last-command` came back empty (#60). The exit now waits for the
  terminal to hang up (at most a second) before it's handled.
- **Check the record once more after the shim exits.** A program that ends
  at once (`run true`) can record its pid and be gone between two looks,
  and its start was reported as a failure. A failed agent start now says
  how the shim ended and the last of what it wrote to `agent.err` (#64).
- **A free port isn't free for long.** Tests picked one by binding port 0
  and letting go; under load something else took it first, the daemon
  exited with "address in use", and the test waited out its deadline as
  "daemon did not start" (#66). `--listen 127.0.0.1:0` now has the daemon
  pick its own port, bound before anything else, and record it in
  `state/listen`; test daemons use that. `--block-listen 127.0.0.1:0`
  does the same in `state/block-listen`, and illogical-control's `--listen`
  in `listen` beside its database; `--direct-url` and control's
  `--public-url` with port 0 mean the port it got. The Playwright specs
  use all of these (`web/e2e/ports.ts`), and their fake servers listen on
  port 0, so a run takes no port but `E2E_PORT` and two worktrees can run
  the suite at once (#67).
- **A spec module is loaded more than once.** Playwright loads each spec
  in the runner as well as the worker, so a top-level `mkdtempSync` left
  a directory per run that `afterAll` never saw (#62). Make them in
  `beforeAll`; the config's own run directories go when the runner exits.
- **Send a test's HTTP request in one write.** `write!` on a socket writes
  each piece of the format string separately; a handler that answers
  without reading the body (a 404) closed the connection before the body
  went, and the test's next write failed with a broken pipe.
- **A frame from another site may get no storage at all.** With "Block
  third-party cookies", Chrome also refuses a cross-site frame its
  `localStorage`, IndexedDB and service workers. VS Code falls back to
  memory for IndexedDB but not for `localStorage`: it threw, and an editor
  block was blank while the same page on its own worked (#69). Playwright's
  Chrome allows third-party cookies, and 127.0.0.1 and `*.localhost` are
  already different sites, so the specs never saw it. An editor block's
  site now puts a script of illogical's first in its pages that gives the
  window storage in memory when it's refused (`editor/storage.js`), and
  `editors.spec.ts` runs a block in a Chrome profile that blocks
  third-party cookies (`sec-fetch-storage-access: none` says it's
  refused). When a block's page fails in a frame, `RUST_LOG=illogicald::sites=debug`
  logs every request its site refuses, and why.
