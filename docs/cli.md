# The CLI

`illogical` drives the daemon from any shell, and from inside every pane (`ILLOGICAL_PANE` and `ILLOGICAL_SOCK` are set there, and it's on `PATH`).

```

`--json` prints the API's JSON. `--host`, anywhere on the line, is another
daemon; a machine (a VM) is `--machine mN`.

`--ssh DEST` reaches a box with your own `ssh` (your `~/.ssh/config`, keys
and agent; a password or 2FA prompt shows in your terminal once). One master
connection per box carries every command after it. The first time, if the
box has no illogical, it offers to put this version in `~/.local/bin` there
(the release for the box's platform, copied over ssh, so the box needs no
network) and starts its daemon: a systemd user service with lingering where
it can, detached otherwise. Declining is remembered.
`ILLOGICAL_SSH_INSTALL=yes` answers yes, `ILLOGICAL_SSH` replaces the `ssh`
command, and `ILLOGICAL_SSH_AGENT=no` keeps your agent here; otherwise panes
on the box use it (for `git push`) while you're connected. `send` then `wait` only sees what happened
after the send. The same calls are an HTTP API (`/api/...`, documented in
`crates/proto/src/api.rs`) on the Unix socket and, behind the usual access
checks, over the tailnet.

## MCP

`illogical mcp` is an MCP server on stdin and stdout, for clients that
start one as a command. It relays to the daemon's own server at `/mcp`
over its socket (or another daemon's, with `--host`), so it can be
started and stopped freely, and a daemon restart doesn't break it.

```
claude mcp add illogical -- illogical mcp
codex mcp add illogical -- illogical mcp
```

The tools:

| Tool | What it does | Reads only |
|---|---|---|
| `run` | A command in a new tab or split (`cwd`, `split`, `vm`, `vm_tab`, `machine`, `session`, `policy`), typed into a shell so it's in history and you can take over. With `wait`, its exit code and last lines. | no |
| `send_input` | Text (Enter after it unless `enter: false`) and named keys (`C-c`, `Up`) to a pane; to an agent block, its next prompt; to an app block, a prompt to its box's agent (`tab`: which) | no |
| `read_output` | A pane's output as text: the latest, from an `offset`, or its `last_command`'s. Paged (16,000 characters by default): pass `next_offset` back | yes |
| `capture_screen` | What a pane shows now | yes |
| `wait` | Until `command_end`, `exit`, `match` (a `pattern`), `idle` or `needs_input`. After `timeout` seconds (100 by default) it answers "still running" with the offset: call it again | yes |
| `list` | Panes and blocks: where, what they run, attention, who started them | yes |
| `close` | Close a pane or block (and a VM it owns) | no |
| `history` | Commands across panes: `failed`, `since` and `before` (`2d`, `36h`), `cwd`, `match` | yes |
| `search` | Lines of output matching a regex | yes |
| `open_port` | A browser block on a port of a pane's machine, beside it | no |
| `open_app` | One of the user's studio apps as an app block, beside a pane; without `app`, their apps | no |
| `start_agent` | An agent block (Claude Code, Codex, Fountain, any ACP agent) with a prompt; `as_fountain` (Claude Code): wear one of the user's Fountain agents here | no |
| `prompt_agent` | A prompt to an agent (an agent block, or Claude Code or Codex in a terminal), waited through in one call: `done`, `needs_input` with its question, or `stalled` with its screen's last lines when nothing starts within 5 seconds. An agent waiting on someone isn't typed at (`answering` to answer it) | no |
| `agent_respond` | Allow or deny an agent's pending approval, or answer or skip its question | no |
| `list_conversations` | Claude Code conversations here (a terminal's, the desktop app's): `query`, `cwd`, `live`, `all` | yes |
| `open_conversation` | One as an agent block beside a pane; `then`: `continue` or `fork` | no |
| `read_file` | A text file on this host or a pane's machine, paged | yes |
| `show_changes` | A diff block beside a pane: what changed in its repository (`rev_a`, `rev_b`); returns the files with +/− | no |
| `show_file` | A file block beside a pane, at a `line`, followed live | no |
| `open_workspace` | A chant workspace block beside a pane (`dir`, `env`); returns its members and the gates waiting | no |
| `open_pr` | A pull request (link, `OWNER/REPO#N`, or N in `dir`'s repo) as a block beside a pane; returns it as text | no |
| `read_pr` | A PR block as text, what it waits on the user for, and your drafts (waiting, sent with who and a link, dropped) | yes |
| `open_issue` | An issue (link, `OWNER/REPO#N`, or N in `dir`'s repo) as a block beside a pane; returns it as text | no |
| `read_issue` | An issue block as text: linked PRs, the agent on it and its PR, what it waits on the user for, your drafts | yes |
| `issue_comment`, `issue_new` | Draft a comment on an issue block, or a new issue (a block beside you holding the draft): a card the user sends, edits or drops | no |
| `list_agents` | The user's Fountain agents, one compact row each (`query` over names, descriptions, skills and servers; `source`: agent-specs, hand or app) | yes |
| `read_agent` | One Fountain agent's whole recipe (prompt, skills, MCP servers, model, metadata), its servers' credentials as `${VAR}`s | yes |
| `open_fountain` | The Fountain agent catalog as a block beside a pane (`query`, `source`); returns the list. `view: "runner"`: this host as the Fountain runner and its sandboxes instead | no |
| `pr_comment`, `pr_review`, `pr_merge` | Draft a comment, a review (`event`) or a merge on a PR block: a card the user sends, edits or drops; returns the draft's id at once | no |

`illogical://block/{id}`.

Waits send a progress notification every 15 seconds: over HTTP, Claude
Code drops a call that's silent for 60. If a long build still doesn't fit,
`MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` raises Claude Code's own limit, but the tools return
"still running" well before any limit.

**Over HTTP.** The daemon serves the same tools at `/mcp` (Streamable
HTTP). On this machine, prefer `illogical mcp` (above); over loopback a
client shows the daemon's local token (`local-token` in the state
directory) or a token from `illogical mcp token`, as its bearer. From your
own machines on the tailnet nothing more is needed:

```
claude mcp add --transport http illogical https://home.<tailnet>.ts.net/mcp
```

A client without a tailnet identity of its own (a tagged node, a
container) needs a token:

```
illogical mcp token --name ci                 # prints ilm_…, once
claude mcp add --transport http illogical https://home.<tailnet>.ts.net/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ilm_…"
illogical mcp token --revoke ci               # its next call is refused
```

`--scope read` makes a token that sees and calls the read-only tools only.
`illogical mcp --token T` (or `ILLOGICAL_MCP_TOKEN`) sends one through the
bridge.

**Agent blocks** get the server without asking: local agents as `/mcp` on
loopback (or `illogical mcp`, if the agent doesn't take HTTP servers), with
a token of their own that only reaches the block's tab. An agent can start
panes and blocks there (on the tab's machine, in a VM tab), drive and
close what it started, and read the rest of its tab; other tabs and new
VMs are refused. The token ends with the block, and stays out of its log.

An agent in a VM can't reach the host, so the daemon reaches in: it runs a
small relay in the VM (python3, on a Unix socket in `/tmp`) over a non-TTY
exec, and serves each connection to it as an MCP session with the same
scope. The agent's server is a small client for that socket. What the
agent runs lands on its own machine, which then becomes its tab's (as
*Share machine with tab* does), so it stays while those panes do. Agents
in Fountain's sandboxes don't get it.

**Who did it.** Every call is logged with the client's name and token. A
pane or block an MCP client started says "started by mcp:CLIENT" (the
client's own name, `claude-code` say), and what it typed is in history as
`mcp:CLIENT`'s.

## Claude Code in a pane

Claude Code in an ordinary pane can tell you when it needs you, put its
questions and permission prompts on cards anyone on the team who may
answer can answer (from the pane, the swarm's rail or a notification), and
take its next instruction from them. All of it is hooks, in
`~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json

Outside an illogical pane every one of these does nothing, so the hooks
are safe everywhere. Take only the lines you want: each group below works
on its own.

**Attention** (`Notification`, the first `Stop`). The Notification hook's
message ("Claude needs your permission to use Bash") becomes the headline
`illogical attention` shows. Without these, an agent going quiet
mid-command is the fallback.

**Questions** (`PreToolUse` on `AskUserQuestion`). `illogical ask` shows
Claude Code's questions as a card over the pane (the pane needs you, with
a push notification), waits, and hands your answers to Claude Code, which
then never shows its picker. *Answer in terminal* on the card gives you the
picker instead; Esc or Ctrl-C in Claude Code withdraws the card. The
timeout (7 days, in seconds) is how long a question may wait; Claude
Code's default would give up after 10 minutes and show its picker. If the
daemon restarts while it waits, the card comes back.

**Permission prompts** (`PermissionRequest`, with `PreToolUse`,
`PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure` and `UserPromptSubmit` so the card can
tell when the terminal answered first). A permission prompt becomes a card
with the tool, its input (the command, the file and its diff) and Claude
Code's own "always allow" suggestions: *Allow*, *Always: …* (keeps that
rule, as the terminal's option would), or *Deny* with a message Claude
reads. Claude Code shows its own dialog too, and whichever answers first
wins: a "Yes" in the terminal closes the card when the tool runs, "No" or
Esc withdraws it. AskUserQuestion is left to `illogical ask`.

Anyone who may edit the pane's session may answer, from the card, the
swarm's rail, `illogical`'s API or a notification. The card then says who
answered ("Allowed by Sam, 14:02"), and so do the pane's history
(`illogical history`, `illogical log %N --who`) and the audit log. Viewers
see the card but can't answer it.

**Follow-ups** (`illogical inbox` on `Stop` and `SessionStart`, in the
background with `asyncRewake`). After an answer, the card offers *Send a
follow-up*. It reaches Claude Code through the inbox hook, which waits
after every turn and wakes it with the text as its next instruction, so it
never mixes with whatever the driver has half typed. It's recorded as its
sender's input. Who may send one is who may drive the pane: on someone's
own machine a teammate needs their trust first (the card offers to ask for
30 minutes); on a team's machine or a VM, team editors send straight away.
A session nobody drives (`claude -p`, the Agent SDK: Claude Code sets
`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ATTENDED=0`) gets no follow-ups, and the hook leaves it
at once, so the same settings don't hold a headless run.

**From a script:**

```
illogical attention --json                    # every pane that wants you: ask, failed, exited, input, done
curl --unix-socket "$ILLOGICAL_SOCK" -X POST localhost/api/attention/act \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"action":"allow","panes":[3,7]}'
curl --unix-socket "$ILLOGICAL_SOCK" -X POST localhost/api/panes/3/followup \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"text":"now run the tests"}'
```

`/api/attention/act` takes `action` (`allow`, `deny`, `answer`,
`dismiss`, and for M28 `accept`, `reject` and `continue`) and a `pane` or
a list of `panes`, plus `option: "always"` and `suggestion: N` (which of
Claude Code's suggestions) for allow, `message` for deny, `content` (the
card's fields) for answer and `text` (the file as it should be saved) for
accept. Each pane is checked on its own (editor on its session) and
answered on its own.

**Diffs** (M28, no hooks needed). Claude Code in a pane connects to
illogicald as its IDE (`CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT` is set in every pane), and
its Edit and Write calls wait as diff cards on the pane and the rail:
accept, change then accept, or reject. `GET /api/panes/N/diff` has the
file before and after. With the `PermissionRequest` hook too, the diff
card is what shows for an edit; the hook still covers Bash and the rest.
In `acceptEdits` mode Claude Code sends no diffs.

**Notifications.** The owner is always told. Anyone else who may answer
chooses which agents notify them: *Notify me about its agents* in the
session menu (or the phone's sheet), or `POST /api/notify` with `{"session": N, "on": true}` (no
session: everything they may edit there). This holds for the daemon's own
push and for pushes through illogical control.
