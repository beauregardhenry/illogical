// Every host at once (M25): a summaries-only connection (M23) to each
// machine in the directory, merged into one list of panes, where a pane is
// (host, pane id). The tab view still connects for real to the one host it
// shows; this only knows what every pane is up to, which is what the swarm
// draws. Control never sees terminal content, so the merge happens here.
//
// - Each host keeps its own transport (tailnet, dial-out, provider tunnel,
//   or an end-to-end channel through control). Relayed ones share one
//   socket to control (see e2e/relaymux.ts).
// - A host is `connected`, `stale` (it dropped; its panes stay, greyed,
//   from the last summary, with when it was last heard), `offline` (never
//   reached, or gone a while), `asleep` (a sandbox whose provider says it
//   sleeps: never woken just to be counted) or `capped` (over the
//   connection cap: shown from what was last known).
// - Connects go through a small limiter with jitter, so a laptop waking
//   with 20 hosts doesn't open 20 sockets at once, and a slow or dead host
//   only holds its own slot for a few seconds.
// - A heartbeat notices a link that died without closing.
