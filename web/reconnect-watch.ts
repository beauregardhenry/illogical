// A headless web client for tests that take a daemon away under it and
// bring it back (#26's "the phone reconnects on its own", #214 section 4).
// It signs in with a sign-in link, shows one pane, and prints a JSON line
// each time what it sees changes:
//
//   {"connected":true,"marker":true,"restored":false,"loads":1}
//
// `marker`: the pane's text has MARKER; `restored`: it has the restore
// marker; `loads`: page loads so far (a reconnect on its own keeps it at 1).
// Nothing is clicked or reloaded after the first load. It runs until killed
// or its stdin closes.
//
//   node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings reconnect-watch.ts SIGNIN_URL PANE MARKER [VIA]
//
// VIA (host:port) is where the browser really connects for SIGNIN_URL's
// host and port, such as an ssh forward: the daemon only answers to its own
// host names, so the page keeps the link's (localhost:7681) and Chromium
// maps it to the forward.
//
// Uses Playwright's Chromium (`pnpm exec playwright install chromium`).
