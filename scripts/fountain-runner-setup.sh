#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Make this machine a Fountain runner (M45): the root half. Run it once, as
# root through sudo, from the account that will look after the runner:
#
#   sudo bash scripts/fountain-runner-setup.sh \
#     --fountain "$(command -v fountain)" --node "$(node -p process.execPath)"
#
# Then, without root: `illogical fountain runner install` creates the
# runner's key, writes it for the `fountain` user and starts the unit.
#
# What it does:
#   - a `fountain` user and group (home /home/fountain, mode 0750), with the
#     invoking user ($SUDO_USER, or --user) in the group, so sandboxes can be
#     read and diffed without root;
#   - /home/fountain/sandboxes (2750: new files keep the group) as --root;
#   - /opt/fountain-node: a copy of node and npm (npx with it). Fountain's
#     runner needs bash, git, node, npm and npx on its PATH, and the user's
#     own node (nvm, mise) is in a home the `fountain` user can't read, so it
#     gets a root-owned copy of just node and npm (about 140 MB);
#   - /usr/local/bin/fountain: a copy of the CLI (run this again to upgrade);
#   - /etc/sudoers.d/illogical-fountain, checked with `visudo -cf`: the user
#     may run bash as `fountain` (a shell in a sandbox, and writing its key),
#     and as root `systemctl start|stop|restart|status fountain-runner`,
#     nothing else;
#   - /etc/systemd/system/fountain-runner.service (User=fountain,
#     Restart=always, UMask=0027 so the group can read; ProtectProc=invisible,
#     so its agents can't read other users' processes' command lines in
#     /proc; systemd 247 or later; IPAddressDeny=localhost, so its agents
#     can't reach services on this machine's loopback, like illogicald,
#     except systemd-resolved's DNS stub), enabled. The unit is the one source of
#     truth: an interim drop-in (fountain-runner.service.d/10-protect-proc.conf)
#     is removed, with its directory if that leaves it empty. It starts
#     once its key exists (ConditionPathExists), so at boot without one it's
#     skipped rather than failing in a loop.
#
# Options:
#   --user USER       who gets the group and the sudoers rule [$SUDO_USER]
#   --name NAME       the runner's name [this host's short name, lowercased]
#   --fountain PATH   the fountain CLI to copy [`command -v fountain`]
#   --node PATH       the node executable whose node and npm to copy
#                     [`command -v node`]
#   --allow-loopback  let the runner's agents use loopback (a dev server they
#                     start and test, say): no IPAddressDeny=localhost
#   --dry-run DIR     write every file under DIR instead of /, print the
#                     commands instead of running them; needs no root
#   --uninstall       undo it all; the user, its home and the sandboxes stay
#   --purge           with --uninstall: remove the user, its home and every
#                     sandbox too
